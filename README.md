# Airport Challenge - Javascript

This project is a recreation of the airport challenge, which was done in week 1 of Makers, using strict TDD and Javascript.

## Getting Started

I used Jasmine as the test suite for this. To add to your repo, download the standalone file from https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases and `unzip` in your repo.
`git init` your repo and start creating files

### User Stories

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Installing Jasmine

```
Visit https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases and download preferred standalone version. 3.3.0 was used in this project
Copy into your project repository
$ unzip jasmine-standalone-3.3.0.zip
It has some examples files by default. Look at these to see how it works and delete once no longer necessary
```


## Running the tests

To run test `open Specrunner.html` in your terminal. This will open a browser window with the tests. Just refresh the page if you want to re-run your tests.
